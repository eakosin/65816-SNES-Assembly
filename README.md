# Basic 65816 SNES Assembly Autocomplete

I wrote this in like an hour so I can stop Googling what every opcode does instead of actually remembering them

cannibalized from [my other langserver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vicerust.overwatch&ssr=false) and the language highlighting from [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshneta.65816-assembly&ssr=false)
