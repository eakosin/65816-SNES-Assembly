# Basic 65816 SNES Assembly Autocomplete

This extension provides basic programmatic support for SNES Assembly, with the primary use being SMW Romhacking.

Currently supported features:

*  Syntax Highlighting
*  Opcode definitions on hover, along with extended documentation courtesy of randomdude999 and [this wonderful guide](https://media.smwcentral.net/randomdude999/snes_references/65C816_opcodes.html)
*  RAM Address definitions on hover, pulled from the [SMW Memory Map](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=memorymap&game=smw)
*  Document outline support for subroutines. Currently only in alphabetical order, a limitation with VSC.
